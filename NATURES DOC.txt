✅ **Key Instruction for the Agent / Dev Team:**

> **Do not modify or redo any task or module that is already complete and functional. Only continue with the remaining tasks necessary to make the website fully functional, testable, and ready for client review.**

This version now ensures:

* Everything needed for a **fully functional, testable website** is included

If you want, I can now **also create a visual sitemap + module flow diagram** for this final prompt, showing:

* Dashboards, modules, roles, and access hierarchy
* Completed vs remaining tasks

This will make it **very easy for the agent or dev team to implement and track progress**.

Do you want me to do that next?
